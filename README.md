# Machine-Learning
Here are all the codes for Machine Learning techniques I have learned.

* **Logistic Regression**  
   * Made some functions like **sigmoid, initialize** with zeros, **propagate, optimize** using gradient descent, **predict** binary classified output and the **model** function**.
* **Simple Neural Network**  
   * Added some functions like **plot decision boundary, initialize parameters, forward propagation, compute cost, backward propagation, update parameters, nn_model** and **predict**.
* **Deep Neural Network**  
   * Added some more functions like **relu, L_layer_model, relu backwards**.
* **Hyperparameter Tuning**  
   * Initialization
   * Regularization
   * Gradient Checking
* **Optimization**  
   * Gradient Descent, gradient descent with momentum and adam optimization techniques implemented
